# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Introduction
Financial fraud is a growing concern in today's digital world, where millions of transactions occur daily. Identifying fraudulent transactions in real time is crucial for preventing financial losses and protecting users. In this project, we develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on real-world data.

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a fraud detection system using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of anonymized financial transactions, with each transaction labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. The primary objectives of this project are:

## Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Understanding patterns and cleaning data.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features to improve model performance.
Model Selection & Training: Comparing different models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation & Optimization: Tuning hyperparameters and handling data imbalance to improve accuracy.
Deployment Possibilities: Discussing potential real-world applications of the trained model.

## Model Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## Expected Outcomes
A machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall.
Insights into the most relevant features that contribute to identifying fraud.
A roadmap for deploying the model in real-time fraud detection systems.
